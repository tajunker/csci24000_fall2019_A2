Goals - This program takes a predetermined array of 9 elements and using a bubblesort sorts the elements in the array.
Input - This program does not take in input as the elements in the array to be sorted are already predetermined.
Output - This program outputs the array as each element is sorted and swapped.
Steps - For this program 3 functions are used - printValues(), sort(), and swap(). 
        printValues() prints the values in the array values[] using a for loop to print the array as the integers are swapped with        its neiboring elements. 
        sort() sorts the values in array values[]. This function uses a bubblesort to compare the elements and swap the elements a        s necessary with nested for loop.
        swap() swaps the values in the array values[] after the sorting is made in the previous function swap function swaps
        the elemets in the array as necessary.
